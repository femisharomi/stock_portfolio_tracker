#### install dev dependencies
Also from the project root level:

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/server`
